# My Portfolio
### By Ian Agpawa
##### This repo is for my portfolio project from the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree course.    


### Quick Start
-Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/TheArtilect/u-portfolio.git`


#### Viewing the app
You can run the app by either opening the `index.html` file with your browser.

Alternatively, you can run the following command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the terminal while in the project folder and then direct your browser to `0.0.0.0:8000`.

If there are any additional projects included in the `my_projects.py` file, run `python my_projects.py` to update/generate the `projects.js` file, and will also open the browser with `index.html`.

The `convertImages.py` script was used to convert the original .png files stored in `images/images_src/` into .jpg files and migrated to `images/images-jpg/`  A `grunt` command was then executed resize the images appropriately.
